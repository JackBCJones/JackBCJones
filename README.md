Hi, I'm Jack. I'm a developer based in Cape Town, South Africa. 

I'm interested in continuous learning, reading and making apps that hopefully help others.

I'm currently on a bit of a war path trying to figure out the back-end. I've got experience with building web apps that I think look great but I'm interested
in how to get them to work with a server and potentially host my own website.

I'm always keen to collaborate on projects, I've just finished doing some webscraping for an information website that will help some friends of mine.
