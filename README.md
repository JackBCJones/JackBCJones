Hey, I'm Jack, an engineer based in Cape Town. I'm currently a junior software engineer working as a full-stack developer at a web3 company aimed at sports fan engagement. I'm really interested in learning more about the web3 space and potentially becoming a web3 engineer. Please feel free to reach out â€“ I'm always keen to meet new people in the space!
