As a self-taught software developer, I have gained practical experience through developing an app called 'Find My Degree'. This app stores information on university courses and requirements, aimed at helping aspiring university students find the information they need in one place. Over the past 6 months, I have honed my skills by working on this app and completing various coding projects, which have helped me to learn new programming concepts. Additionally, I have taken a number of courses on CodeCademy and FreeCodeCamp to further enhance my knowledge and skills in the field. My goal is to continue growing as a software developer and to work on challenging projects that allow me to make a positive impact.
